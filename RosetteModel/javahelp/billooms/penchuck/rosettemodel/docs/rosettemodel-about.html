        <h2>About Rosettes</h2>
	  <p>
		  Each rosette has a specified style which describes the fundamental shape of each lobe.
		  Although users with traditional machines may prefer the "A, B, C..." designation, 
		  many newcomers find the nomenclature to be difficult to remember as it is not descriptive. 
		  This program attempts to use more descriptive terms for the rosette patterns, 
		  but retains the "A, B, C..." designation in parenthesis where applicable.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>
			  <b>None</b> is just a plain round circle with no bumps or lobes.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>N-Side</b> is similar to a <b>C</b> rosette on traditional rose engines.
			  It is made from an n-sided polygon (i.e. triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, etc).
			  At some amplitude, it will accurately reproduce the n-sided polygon.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>Flower</b> is similar to a <b>D</b> rosette on traditional rose engines.
			  It is the inverse of the <b>N-Side</b> rosette.
			  That is, you get the same effect from rubbing on the front side of a <b>Flower</b> rosette
			  as you get by rubbing on the back of an <b>N-Side</b> rosette.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>Sine</b> is similar to an <b>A</b> rosette on traditional rose engines.
			  The lobes are defined by a sine wave function.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>Heart</b> is similar to an <b>F</b> rosette on traditional rose engines.
			  With a single repeat, it will show a traditional heart shape.
			  With more repeats, the heart pattern is repeated around the rosette.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>Lotus</b> is similar to the lotus pattern on a rosette made for the MDF rose engine by Jon Magill.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>BigSmall</b> is similar to a <b>B</b> rosette on traditional rose engines.
			  The larger lobe consumes 2/3 of the pattern repeat distance,
			  and the smaller lobe consumes 1/3 of the pattern repeat distance.
			  Each lobe is the same as a <b>Flower</b> lobe.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>BigSmall Inverse</b> is the inverse of the <b>BigSmall</b> rosette.
			  That is, you get the same effect from rubbing on the front side of a <b>BigSmall Inverse</b> rosette
			  as you get by rubbing on the back of an <b>BigSmall</b> rosette.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>Triangle</b> is a simple triangle that is "bent" around the round shape of a rosette.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>Tudor Rose</b> is inspired by a traditional tudor rose pattern.
			  Although the traditional pattern has 5 repeats, the user is free to specify any number of repeats around the rosette.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <b>Index</b> is essentially an index wheel.
		  </li>
	  </ul>
